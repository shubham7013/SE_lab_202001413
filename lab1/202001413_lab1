Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
  The product has a lot of potential in the modern period since it can assist disabled people, whose population is large and who this innovation is assisting by resolving urgently pressing concerns.
->Feartures:
  The features are made available through a mobile application so that almost everyone can use them.
  The software makes use of artificial intelligence to identify problems that are present in the area and carry out necessary tasks.
  The technology utilised in the backend will identify significant sound events of interest to the community, such as car horns and other sounds, where immediate alerts will be processed and the user informed.

  Because of its low latency, the software can alert the user as quickly as feasible.
->Nonfunctional features
  processed unwanted results as a result of pointless inputs.
  New features should be maintainable, user-friendly, and straightforward to use.
  Scalability and efficiency.
  Availability, Reliability, and Security.
